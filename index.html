		<p>
			Since February 2019, I have being working as a quantitative trading analyst at <a
				href="https://www.drw.com/">DRW</a> on the JAX team.
			During my college years, I spent summers working as a quantitative trading intern at <a
				href="http://www.volanttrading.com/">Volant Trading</a> and as a trading intern at <a
				href="http://www.group1.com/">Group One Trading</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am an alumni of the University of Chicago double majoring in <a
				href="http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/caam/">Computational and Applied Mathematics</a> (a
			mix of math/CS/stats) along with <a
				href="http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/statistics/">Statistics</a>.
			I was the president of <a href="http://mc.uchicago.edu">Maroon Capital</a>, a quantitatively focused RSO on
			campus.
			<br>
			<br>
			This website serves as a home for some of my photography and blog posts about my various musings.
